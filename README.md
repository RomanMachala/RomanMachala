Hey! My name is Roman Machala.

I'm 22 years old, currently finishing my Bachelor's degree at FIT BUT in Brno.
I'm interested in solving interesting programming puzzles/problems and getting better altogether with it.
My future plans are finihsing my studies with Master's degrre, although am not sure still which major I should pick (so many interesting choices).
In my spare time I like to workout, chill out on some video games with some friends or look at some programming problems.
